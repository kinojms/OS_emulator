Changelog


Version 1.1 (updated from the one Rizza Chan sent)
* Separated it into a file structure
* Accepts the initial operators in homework 2
* Has some weird jank specific to VS code where clear would not work properly works when using .exe file
* Implemented code command so we can see current functions


Version 1.2
* Now uses fgets and strcmp to compare inputs
* Exit clear and initialize are the only ones that work until initialize is triggered
* Inputs are made into tokens (essentially just parsing it by space divider)
* Now checks for screen -s before accepting a input note that command still needs screen -s to work
* To run commands just do screen -s <operation>

# CSOPESY Multi-tasking OS Emulator

This project simulates a CLI OS with process execution and memory management, providing a framework for running custom instructions, emulating memory operations, and logging process activity. It is implemented in modern C++ (C++20).

## Features
- Simulates process creation and execution
- Supports custom instruction sets (DECLARE, ADD, SUBTRACT, WRITE, READ, PRINT, etc.)
- Emulates memory operations with demand paging
- Logs process activity and memory access to per-process log files
- Handles instruction parsing and execution with error handling

## Build Instructions
- Requires a C++20 compatible compiler (e.g., MSVC, GCC, or Clang)
- Open the project in Visual Studio 2022

## Usage
- Configure and run the project to simulate process execution and memory management
- Logs are generated in the `process_logs` directory for each process

- Justin Sacdalan
